# Log Extractor

A simple Python script to extract log entries for a specific date from a log file.

## Features
- Extracts logs based on a given date.
- Saves extracted logs to an `output` directory.
- Uses memory mapping (`mmap`) for efficient file reading.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No external dependencies are required. Just ensure you have Python installed.

## Usage
Run the script with the log file path and the date you want to extract logs for:

```sh
python extract_logs.py log_2024.log <YYYY-MM-DD>
Example:
sh
Copy
python extract_logs.py server.log 2024-01-30
This will extract all log entries from server.log that start with 2024-01-30 and save them in output/output_2024-01-30.txt.

Output
The extracted logs will be saved in the output directory as:

bash
Copy
output/output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
Error Handling
If the log file is missing, the script will show an error message.
If the given date format is incorrect, logs may not be extracted correctly.
